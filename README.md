# most-starred-github-projects-cloning-script
This repository contains scripts to mine data from GitHub. I will be updating this repository from time to time as I write or collect new scripts.

1. clone_1k_popular_projects.sh -- 
This bash script clones 1000 most starred i.e. popular (as par November 2019) Java projects in GitHub. This dataset can be used for various empirical software engineering research projects. It will create a folder `Projects` in the same directory as the script and the Java projects will be cloned inside the folder.

2. clone_projects_with_more_than_100_stars.py -- 
This python scripts downloads Java projects with more than or equal to 100 stars. This script required `git` and `python3` to be installed.
